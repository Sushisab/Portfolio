        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Sabrina El-Aouar</strong>, a digital artist and web developer. I enjoy creating digital and traditional artwork.</p>
        <p>I've always enjoyed both art and technology, which led me to pursue a career as both an artist and a developer. It all began with traditional art in school, where I explored painting, drawing, and sculpture. Over time, my interests shifted toward digital art, where I used my skills in software like Photoshop, Illustrator, and other creative tools.</p>
        <p>I have a background in <strong>Graphic Design</strong> and <strong>Web Development</strong>, blending my passion for art, design, and technology to create custom artwork.</p>
        <p>I am always eager to take on new projects and challenges, whether it's creating a commission for a client or collaborating with other creatives. My goal is to collaborate and work with all kinds of artists and technology enthusiasts, using this opportunity to expand my portfolio!</p>
        <p>If you'd like to work with me or have any questions, feel free to reach out. I would love to collaborate!</p>
